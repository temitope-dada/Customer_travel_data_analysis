Customer Travel Data Analysis
This project focuses on cleaning and merging customer and travel data to create a unified dataset for analysis. The raw data was processed using SQL to address missing values, standardize formats, and combine two related tables.

Dataset
The dataset (customer_travel_data.sql) contains:
**Travel Table**: Includes details about trips, destinations, and policy statuses.
