**Customer Travel Data Analysis**
This project focuses on cleaning and merging customer and travel data to create a unified dataset for analysis. The raw data was processed using SQL to address missing values, standardize formats, and combine two related tables.

**Steps Taken**
*Data Cleaning*
Replaced inconsistent gender identifiers (f and m) with "Female" and "Male".
Addressed missing values by removing rows with null
Standardized column formats for better consistency.

*Data Merging*
Combined the Customer and Travel tables using a common key (CustomerID) to create a unified view of customer and travel data.

*Output Dataset*
Generated a clean and merged dataset, ready for further exploration or use in analysis.
